## Outline

This lesson provides an introduction to the data science process and challenges generally faced by data scientists at different stages of this process. Students will be introduced to different roles within data science domain with a focus on similarities and differences within these roles. This would allow students to better position themselves for a role that suits their skills and aspirations. Following this introduction, the lesson provides a quick overview of tools and technologies currently being employed for data scientists for data collection, exploration and analysis. Python would be identified as a tool of choice and students will be provided a strong rationale in support of using Python for compkete data science process. 

The second half of taught component will introduce students to key data types generally used for collection and processing data within python, followed by coding exercises to pratice these datatypes for simple examples.
