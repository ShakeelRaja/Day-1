## Python (Introduction 15 mins)
Python is a general purpose programming language which is heavily being used by data scientists alongside R and MATLAB. Python is generally preferred as a tool of choice for data analysis for following reasons:

* Python is open source which reduces the cost of analysis as compared to proprietary solutions like MATLAB 
* Python has a massive online community 
* Comparatively easier to learn and program due to high level abstractions
* Python can handle different types of data ranging from structured data  e.g. relational databases, NoSQL, csv, Jason, XML to unstructured data e.g. images, video and text
* Python has many package as suitable for simpler Analytics projects (eg. segmentation, cohort analysis, explorative analytics, etc.) as advanced Data Science projects (eg. building machine learning models)
* The industry is keen to hire data professionals with solid Python knowledge. It means knowing Python will be an extremely competitive element in your career development
* Python is applicable to the complete data science process from data collection, pre-processing to predictive modelling and visualisations. 

You dont have to learn every functional offering by Python for data analysis. A basic understanding of datatypes offered by Python along with a clear understanding of Python syntax can allow you to start getting engaged into basic data analysis experiments. For advanced analysis, Python packages including SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, ScikitLearn and TensorFlow are popular choices for machine learning and deep learning experiments. 



## Python Basics (2 hours, including 10 minutes explanation for each exercise)

Following section requires you to go through a number of practical exercises which would help you understand basic progaramming concepts in Python. 

* Declaring and Assigning Variables

* More Datatypes

[This example will show a simple song analysis experiment using the concepts explained above and also introducing some new datatypes including lists and dictionaries](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/instant-datascience)
