# Day 1 : Introduction to Data Science  (Beta)

Day 1 of the skills course in Data Science provides a quick introduction to data science domain and different analytics roles that students may start thinking about for career development. This lesson provides an introduction to Python as a language of choice and compares it with other maintstream platforms used for data analysis. For the pracrical part, the lesson introducdes some basic data types and operators in Python and methods to manipulate them. The lesson also provides an introduction to data I/O along with student centred simple coding exercises in Python. 

SWBATS: 

* Descrice the data science process with a clear understanding of stages involved. 
* Understand different roles within data analytics domain with required skillset
* Compare different programming paradigms for data science and provide a rational for using Python. 
* Define basic data types in Python and perform operations on these data types
* Running a simple program with user prompted data input and output.



**Lesson 1 (part1)** 40 - 45 minutes.

##  Learning Objectives

* The "Data Science Process" 
* Different Roles in the data analytics domain


This part provides a quick introduction to data science domain, data science process and comparison of different industrial roles within the domain of data analytics. There are a couple of short exercises aimed at developing critical thinking around these topics. Students should be advised to think blue skies with these exercises. This should allow them to relate future topics to practical use in a better way. 


**Lesson 1 (part 2)** would last for around 2 hours. 

## Learning Objectives

* Introduction to Data Science Tools and Technologies
* Python Programming Language and rationale for adoption
* Basic data types (Strings, Numbers and Boolean) with coding exercises
* Python variable declaration, assignment and re-assignment with coding exercises
* Python user I/O with coding exercises

Each coding exercise should be explained in about 10 minutes and another 20 minutes for students to try out the code.  provides a brief introduction to some of the programming environments used for data analysis including MATLAB, R and Python. Students will be provided with a rationale behind choosing python as a language of choice for data science experiments. This lesson then links to the coding exercises which have been developed by data science team at Flatiron to introduce basic programming concepts in Python including variable declaration and assignment, string and numercial data types and summing it all up with the song analysis experiment.
