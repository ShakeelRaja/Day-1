# Day 1 (Beta)

**Lesson 1 (part1)** is written to last for 40 - 45 minutes.

This part provides a quick introduction to data science domain, data science process and comparison of different industrial roles within the domain of data analytics. There are a couple of short exercises aimed at developing critical thinking around these topics. Students should be advised to think blue skies with these exercises. This should allow them to relate future topics to practical use in a better way. 


**Lesson 1 (part 2)** would last for around 2 hours. 

Each coding exercise should be explained in about 10 minutes and another 20 minutes for students to try out the code.  provides a brief introduction to some of the programming environments used for data analysis including MATLAB, R and Python. Students will be provided with a rationale behind choosing python as a language of choice for data science experiments. This lesson then links to the coding exercises which have been developed by data science team at Flatiron to introduce basic programming concepts in Python including variable declaration and assignment, string and numercial data types and summing it all up with the song analysis experiment. 

To-Do:
* Day 1 Conclusion and Summary (5 - 10 minutes), 
* 4 - 5 External links to some interesting yet easy to understand (non-technical) data science articles e.g. Google flu predictor. (This is optional and would help keen students to develop a broader understanding of the domain)
* Improve the flow of information and check for disjoint bits and pieces of information. 
* Tidy up up the repo. 

* Consider using a simpler version of data science process e.g. [this](https://cdn.slidemodel.com/wp-content/uploads/7309-01-data-science-powerpointp-template-16x9-04-870x489.jpg) or [this](http://54.159.122.118/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1_Activities_D.png). There are other simpler representations that can be considered
